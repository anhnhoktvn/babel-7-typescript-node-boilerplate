# Node.js + TypeScript + Webpack

A quick example of a TypeScript project that uses Babel 7 to produce a Node.js application with Webpack bundling for production builds.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/sellmeadog/babel-7-typescript-node-boilerplate.git [project_directory]
yarn install
```

Since this is a boilerplate, you can clone to an optional `[project_directory]` initially instead of renaming the repo later.

## Development

```
yarn start
yarn test
```

## Build

```
yarn build
```

## Disclaimer

This boilerplate is just meant to get you started and not to be considered "production ready."
